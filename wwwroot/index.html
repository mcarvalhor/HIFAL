				<h1>Welcome to HIFAL!</h1>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>HIFAL is running now. Please, upload a website or resources in the web root folder. By default, this is the "wwwroot" folder.</p>
				<p>Please, be aware of the following remarks:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>HIFAL doesn't support HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) yet.</li>
						<li>HIFAL doesn't serve dynamic content. HIFAL only serves static files. By that, a *.php or *.py file will never be interpreted or executed, but instead downloaded by user's browser.</li>
						<li>There's no hidden files or folders in HIFAL. Everything under web root folder is visible and available to the web.</li>
						<li>Folder listing (or directory listing) is enabled in HIFAL. When a user accesses a folder path, first HIFAL tries to find a "index.html" file in this folder. If none is found, then its subfolders and files are listed.</li>
						<li>HIFAL is not multithreaded, which means it can't serve multiple users connecting at the website at once. Instead, it serves only a single user at a time. If this user is downloading a large file, for example, then the whole website is offline to other users until the download is completed.</li>
					</ul>
